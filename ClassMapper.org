* Tasks
** DONE Evaluate last checkin, push if complete.
** DONE Push new documentation.
** DONE Move private methods into anonymous category.
** DONE Add ability to write a global preproc for dict: toClass:.
** TODO Add a way to map remote key names to locals (not sure if this should be local or global).
** TODO Add custom deserialization routines for mutability issues at least.
** TODO Figure out a better solution to the arrays of serialized objects problem. The MapperConfig system is infinitely less than ideal, but does the job in simple cases. If a better solution cannot be found, there needs to be a way to override the MapperConfig for certain calls.

* Categories to bundle
** TODO Set
** TODO Boolean

* KVC edge cases to investigate
