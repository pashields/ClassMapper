* Tasks
** TODO Document debug options
** TODO Figure out a better solution to the arrays of serialized objects problem. The MapperConfig system is infinitely less than ideal, but does the job in simple cases. If a better solution cannot be found, there needs to be a way to override the MapperConfig for certain calls.
** TODO Remove the mapper config singleton. There is still probably a singleton involved in this, but we need to have a simpler way to support interacting with multiple services that may have conflicting mapper configs.

* KVC edge cases to investigate
** DONE Figure out if one -> many relationships are any different for us.
*** They are. They are also nasty from our perspective. That being said, supporting them is more or less necessary to make classmapper work easily with core data. This is something to hack on soon.
